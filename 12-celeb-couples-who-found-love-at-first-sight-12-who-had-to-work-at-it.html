Some of them fall in love at first sight while others first become friends. Of course, there is no denying that love at first sight stories are more romantic than those that involve years of friendship. Still, many believe that there is no better recipe for a successful relationship – and consequently, marriage – than years of friendship. After all, whereas initial attraction and lust may fade, real friendship is bound to survive. If you know the person you are deciding to have a romantic relationship with – or even to marry – inside out, how can it go wrong, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, there is no right or wrong way to go about romance and indeed while some friends-turned-lovers go on to live happily ever after, so do a lot of couples that fall in love at first sight.</p><p>In Hollywood, you’ll find a mixture of couples that fell in love at first sight and those that were friends first and foremost. Indeed, couples on both camps seem happy , thus further proving that when it comes to love, no one has all the answers!</p><h2 id=love-at-first-sight---aaron-paul-and-lauren-parsekian>Love At First Sight - Aaron Paul And Lauren Parsekian</h2><p>This year marks Aaron Paul’s and Lauren Parsekian’s sixth year of marriage but they are as in love as ever. Plus, they now have a daughter whom they named Story. As you may recall, the Breaking Bad star met his future wife at Coachella. It was apparently love at first sight for both of them.</p><p>Indeed, Paul said, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starcasm</a>, that the night he met Parsekian was simply magical and that he knew straight away that he was going to marry her, and even told her so! –</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“The first night her and I hung out, we had our first kiss on the Ferris wheel.

I don’t want to deal with that, I am too old now to be with a guy that all the girls are like after him. ‘You’re too hot, this is going to be so much work. I’m not kidding,’ I didn’t want to go out with him because of how hot he was.”</p><p>Still, in the end, Vergara could not resist Manganiello’s charm and eventually went on a date with him. Before she knew it, he had proposed and she had said yes! And even though Vergara was initially against the idea of going out – let alone marrying – Manganiello, their relationship moved at a quite fast pace – he proposed only six months after they first started going out and married her only 11 months later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love-at-first-sight---channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan>Love At First Sight - Channing Tatum And Jenna Dewan</h2><p>Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan were co-stars before they were lovers. They co-starred in the movie Step Up but clearly had a thing for each other right from the very beginning. Indeed, Tatum even confessed that initially, he tried to fight off the attraction he felt for Dewan because he had just gotten out of a long relationship and did not want anything serious. And, he felt like he could not be anything but serious with Dewan.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle </a>magazine, Tatum said –</p><p><strong>“I had just gotten out of a pretty long relationship, so I was in no way ready for another. I was trying to run from what I knew Jenna was—not someone I was just going to date. But one of my buddies was like, 'What are you doing, man? She's dope.' That night I showed up at her hotel room with a sombrero on, and that was it."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sounds quite romantic (minus the sombrero), but Dewan later added to the story by confessing that she had told Tatum that if he wanted to date other people he could, but that she wanted to be in a relationship. Apparently, Tatum then went on a wild night of tequila drinking and realized that he couldn’t stop thinking about her. He then knocked at Dewan’s door in the middle of the night – half-naked, wearing only Ugg boots, a sombrero, and underwear – and confessed his feelings to her. And the rest is history.</p><h2 id=had-to-work-at-it---ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossi>Had To Work At It - Ellen DeGeneres And Portia de Rossi</h2><p>Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are one of the most famous same-sex couples not only in Hollywood, but also in the world. And yet their relationship was not an easy one. Coming out is never easy, especially when you are a celebrity. And while nowadays both women feel comfortable in their own skins there was a time when de Rossi felt like she could not come out of the closet.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a> magazine, de Rossi was instantly attracted to DeGeneres –</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"It took me three years to actually tell her how I felt about her because I was on Ally McBeal at the time and I was not living as an openly gay person. I was closeted and very afraid it would be the end of my career, so I wasn't about to date the most famous lesbian in the world."</strong></p><p>The attraction that de Rossi felt for DeGeneres only intensified when she met&nbsp;her a few years later at a photoshoot, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a> magazine “I just walked over to say hello to her, and I couldn't believe it, but she turned around and it was like an arrow was shot through my heart. I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it."</p><p>Luckily, all worked out okay in the end and the couple got married in 2008 when the ban was overturned by the Supreme Court in California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love-at-first-sight---tom-hanks-and-rita-wilson>Love At First Sight - Tom Hanks And Rita Wilson</h2><p>Most of us meet potential romantic partners either through friends or at work so it comes as no surprise that things work pretty much the same way in Hollywood. Indeed, it was at work that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson first met. And they instantly fell in love.</p><p>The couple met in 1985 on the set of the film Volunteers. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People </a>magazine, Hanks later said that meeting Wilson was like getting hit by a lightning bolt –</p><p><strong>“Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing — that was that. I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn’t be denied.”</strong></p><p>Hanks and Wilson dated for three years before they got married in 1988. Wilson was actually Hanks’ second wife – his first marriage was to his high school sweetheart named Samantha Lewes with whom he had two kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People </a>magazine, Hanks admitted in an interview with Oprah that while he and Wilson fell in love with one another straight away, other factors have contributed to the success of their relationship – “The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity and our willingness to have an intimate connection. When I married Rita, I thought, ‘This is going to require some change on my part.’ I won’t deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn’t magic — the way it’s shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn’t come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we’ll be with each other — and we’ll get through it.”</p><h2 id=had-to-work-at-it---freddie-prinze-jr-and-michelle-gellar>Had To Work At It - Freddie Prinze Jr. And Michelle Gellar</h2><p>Like so many other celebrities, the actors Freddie Prinze Jr. and Michelle Gellar were co-stars before they were ever lovers.

And I had gone on a date with a handful of them. They would never eat what I would eat. You have to have that in common with me if we’re going to get along. So Sarah came to dinner with me, and we sat down and she ate everything, including a crab that they let walk across the counter, then kill while it was alive in some oil and said, ‘It’s popcorn, try!’ And she ate it without even blinking, and I was like, ‘Yo, my girl is legit.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=love-at-first-sight---gisele-bundchen-and-tom-brady>Love At First Sight - Gisele Bundchen And Tom Brady</h2><p>Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady is another celebrity couple that fell in love at first sight.

Indeed, Moynahan found out that she was pregnant with Brady’s child when Brady and Bundchen had already started dating.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Popsugar </a>magazine, Bundchen knew right away that Brady was the man for her –</p><p><strong>“I knew right away — the first time I saw him. The moment I saw him, he smiled and I was like, that is the most beautiful, charismatic smile I've ever seen! We sat and talked for three hours. I didn't want to leave.

And then, whoops — wake-up call! We were dating two and a half months when he found out, and it was a very challenging situation.

And over a period of time it became clear we were more than just friends.”</p><p>Nowadays George Clooney and Amal are one of the cutest couples in Hollywood and it is obvious that they are as in love with one another now as they were when they first started dating. Indeed, Clooney is always complimenting not only his wife’s personality but also her work as a human rights lawyer as well as her taste in fashion – “Since the day I met her, she’s always had this insanely, it’s eccentric but it’s fun, sense of fashion. And she’s caring. And she also happens to be one of the smartest people I’ve ever met.
