Becoming a mom has created various scenarios in the past. For some, a maternity leave caused a release, while others decided to leave the company themselves. Rosa Mendes recently became a rare case of a WWE employee that was actually able to leave the company on a maternity leave (a rarity). This just goes to show how the company is evolving today. The old WWE would have probably released her. Instead, Mendes is enjoying motherhood and looking forward to an in-ring return in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sad to say, but wrestling is a lot about looks. Once they fade, your time may come to an end on the big stage. Despite the fact that these 15 former wrestling stars became mothers, they still look fantastic today, and you can judge for yourself in this article. So, let’s find out who these hot moms are. Here are 15 of the hottest moms in pro wrestling history. Leave a comment below and let us know who your favorite wrestling mom is. Enjoy!</p><h2 id=15-ashley-massaro>15)&nbsp;Ashley Massaro</h2><p>Unfortunately for Ashley, the only mention of her name today is amongst lists discussing some of the biggest busts in WWE history. Her career got off to a promising start when she won the 2005 Diva Search competition, winning the $250,000 grand prize along with a WWE contract. Despite this, her career was very forgettable. Eventually in July of 2008, the company released Massaro. According to her however, she asked to be released from her contract because her daughter fell ill. Today, her daughter Alexa Massaro, is set to turn 16 in July. Ashley and her daughter are only separated by 21 years as Massaro just recently turned 37. Ashley is definitely deserving of a spot on this list!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-candice-michelle>14)&nbsp;Candice Michelle</h2><p>Set to turn 38 in late September, Candice is currently enjoying her time away from the ring as a mother of three daughters; AkiAnne Rose, Ryumi Grace and just recently in July of 2015, Aloha Von. The former WWE Diva has been married since 2005 to her husband Ken Gee Ehrlich, who is a certified Chiropractor. The couple is currently residing out of Los Angeles, California. Candice is still active in the wrestling community today, appearing in several conventions across the United States. Her memorabilia is actually still quite the hit despite leaving the WWE 7 years ago.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-christy-hemme>13) Christy Hemme</h2><p>Just recently, on January 3rd, 2015, the former Diva Search winner gave birth to her first child, Charlie Rose. At the age of 35, Hemme is still quite active in the wrestling business. After her release by the WWE, Christy joined TNA Wrestling in 2006. Believe it or not, a decade later Hemme was still employed by the company working as a ring announcer. She did recently take time off from the company on maternity leave. Just last month, Christy’s epic TNA run came to an end when she announced her official departure from the wrestling promotion. TNA personality So Cal Val is set to replace her. The former WWE Diva will enjoy motherhood during her time away from the ring. She is also set&nbsp;to&nbsp;attend various wrestling conventions during her time away from TNA Wrestling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=12-mickie-james>12) Mickie James</h2><p>In the last couple of years, <a href=#>Mickie’s</a> life went through a dramatic change. After she started to date TNA wrestler Magnus, the two had a child together in 2014, a boy named Donovan Patrick Aldis. Following the birth of their first child, the couple were married just recently on December 31st, 2015. It remains to be seen what’s next for Mickie who recently made her return onto the independent circuit. She is also appearing at several wrestling conventions. At the age of 36, James still has some gas left in the tank. It remains to be seen how much the Virginia native has left. It’ll be interesting to see if the WWE one day acknowledges her accomplishments in the WWE’s Hall of Fame.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-beth-phoenix>11) Beth Phoenix</h2><p>Just recently, at the WWE Hall of Fame this past April, Beth Phoenix and <a href=#>Edge</a> announced to the WWE universe that they are in fact expecting their second child. Edge marvelled at the fact that Beth was able to take care of a two-year and four month old, while taking care of four dogs, maintaining their home and obtaining a Master’s Degree in forensic psychology, all at the same time. As you can probably tell, at the age of 35, Beth has her hands full at home nowadays. The couple is currently residing out of Asheville, North Carolina.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-jackie-gayda>10) Jackie Gayda</h2><p>Like so many others in the past, Jackie was another casualty of the WWE’s failed Tough Enough experiment. The former WWE employee won the second season taking home the grand prize and a WWE contract. Her in-ring career was less than memorable though, as the 34 year old was rushed way too quickly by the company. In July of 2005, Gayda was let go by the WWE. After a couple of years bouncing around TNA and the independent circuit, Jackie became a full time mother residing out of Dallas, Texas. Married to former WWE star Charlie Haas, Gayda has her hands full taking care of four children which she had between 2006 to 2012. The couple has two girls and two boys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-dawn-marie>9) Dawn Marie</h2><p>At the age of 45, Dawn Marie is enjoying motherhood with two children; a boy Matthew, born in December of 2005, and a girl Katelyn Marie, born in May of 2009. Sadly, the birth of her first child came with some controversy. Dawn filed a complaint against the WWE claiming she had been released by the company because of the birth of her son. Marie filed a wrongful termination claim. She also made a statement saying she felt mental duress from her release at the time as well. Regardless of the situation, Dawn is enjoying motherhood today. Her role as a heel with the WWE was very underrated, although short lived, lasting just a mere three years.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-amy-weber>8) Amy Weber</h2><p>Amy’s professional career took a weird twist following her brief and unimpactful WWE career. The former WWE employee rose to fame in the music scene landing her hit song “Let it Rain”, on the US Billboard chart and on the UK Singles Chart. Things fell perfectly for the mother of two who had two twins Levi and Madison Grace, in 2009 after her WWE release. After a couple of years as a full time mom, Weber later released this hit song which went viral in 2012. As of 2013, the Los Angeles resident was working on several projects which included films and television shows. The Illinois native is 45 today.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-joy-giovanni>7) Joy Giovanni</h2><p>So crazy to think that Giovanni has a son who is set to turn 18 this upcoming October. The former WWE Rookie of the Year Diva was already a mother when she entered the WWE, joining the Diva Search competition. Despite her finishing 3rd, the Boston native was still offered a contract with the company. Her run had a few memorable moments, one in particular was her feud with Amy Weber. Like Weber, her run with the company was very brief and came to an end after only a year’s worth of work, Joy actually retired from the wrestling business altogether. As of 2010, Joy was a chiropractor working out of Los Angeles, California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-eve-torres>6) Eve Torres</h2><p>Very rare to see a Diva retire at her&nbsp;prime, but this was the case with <a href=#>Eve Torres</a> who looked like she was becoming a star in the Women’s Division. Eve shocked the WWE when she requested a release from the company to focus on other ventures. The company had Torres immediately drop the Divas Championship upon her request. Today, the 31 year old is residing out of Torrance, California. The former WWE Diva is married to MMA fighter Rener Gracie. The couple welcomed their first child to the world on September 28th, 2015, a boy, Raeven Gracie.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-michelle-mccool-calaway>5) Michelle McCool-Calaway</h2><p>At the age of 24, McCool took part in the Diva Search competition. Despite a 7th place finish McCool was still given a WWE contract. Her in-ring career was insanely underrated; the Texas resident captured the Divas Championship twice, the Women’s Championship twice and won the prestigious honor for Diva of the Year in 2010. She also won PWI’s women of the year. Her role as a heel was quite memorable, but she later decided to retire in hopes of starting a family with WWE mega star,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Undertaker</a>. The couple had their first child in August of 2012, Kaia Faith Calaway. This was her first child and The Undertaker’s fourth. The couple is currently residing out of Austin, Texas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-rosa-mendes>4) Rosa Mendes</h2><p>Rosa became the latest member of the WWE family to give birth to a child. Recently, the 36 year old became a mother of a beautiful and healthy baby girl, Jordan Elizabeth. Her child was born on February 13th, 2016. The WWE Diva is said to be in terrific shape and is doing very well on her maternity leave. She is expected to return to the company soon and is said to be very excited to come back to the company. As of right now however, she is only focused on being a mom.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-sable>3) Sable</h2><p>Like her husband, Sable always kept her personal life on the down low. Since her marriage to <a href=#>Brock</a>, it seems like Sable has gone missing residing out of Saskatchewan, Canada, out of all the places in the world. Sable became a full time mom, taking care of her two sons; Turk, who is set to turn seven in June and Duke, who is turning six in July. In addition, Sable also has another daughter who actually had a child in September of 2012. If you can believe, the 48 year old is actually a grandmother as well. 15 of the hottest grandmothers in pro wrestling history anyone?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-stephanie-mcmahon>2) Stephanie McMahon</h2><p>Regarded as the WWE’s power couple, <a href=#>Stephanie</a> and <a href=#>Triple H</a>&nbsp;just seem to get better with age. Set to turn 40 in September, it’s pretty fair to acknowledge the fact that Stephanie looks better than ever. It’s like she’s aging backwards. The billion dollar princess looks incredible nowadays, and she can attribute this to her new found love for fitness. Her hard work and dedication is certainly apparent. How she finds the time is an absolute mystery. Not only does she have a prominent role with the company, Steph also has three daughters to take care of; Aurora Rosa, Murphy Claire and Vaughn Evelyn. Her work rate continues to progress year after year.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-stacy-keibler>1) Stacy Keibler</h2><p>Arguably the most beautiful female performer in WWE history, <a href=#>Stacy Keibler</a> recently became a mother giving birth to a girl, Ava Grace. Her daughter was born on August 20th, 2014. Keibler had married Future Ads CEO Jared Pobre, just a couple of months before on March 8th, 2014. The couple recently made headlines in People Magazine spotted at an Aquarium in the Santa Monica area. Keibler is a full time mom and loving her new role away from the public eye. It’ll be interesting to see if the WWE will ever acknowledge her accomplishments as a member of the WWE Hall of Fame.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>celebritybabies.people.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>eonline.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>wwe.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e5BuZKieXam1pnnHqKutnaOpeq67zKxkoqZdpb%2BwedarnKysnJ67qHs%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f15-of-the-hottest-moms-in-pro-wrestling.html&title=15%20Of%20The%20Hottest%20Moms%20In%20Pro%20Wrestling" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-of-the-hottest-moms-in-pro-wrestling.html&description=15%20Of%20The%20Hottest%20Moms%20In%20Pro%20Wrestling" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-of-the-hottest-moms-in-pro-wrestling.html&title=15%20Of%20The%20Hottest%20Moms%20In%20Pro%20Wrestling" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f15-of-the-hottest-moms-in-pro-wrestling.html&title=15%20Of%20The%20Hottest%20Moms%20In%20Pro%20Wrestling" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f15-of-the-hottest-moms-in-pro-wrestling.html&text=15%20Of%20The%20Hottest%20Moms%20In%20Pro%20Wrestling" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f15-of-the-hottest-moms-in-pro-wrestling.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-07-31</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./6-cancelled-celebrities-who-faced-financial-fallout.html><h3>&lt;&lt; 6 &amp;quot;Cancelled&amp;quot; Celebrities Who Faced Financial Fallout</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./volleyball-player-net-worth-therichest.html><h3>Volleyball Player Net Worth | TheRichest >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
